            <h2>What is cookies?</h2>
            <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour,
                sugar,
                egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats,
                chocolate
                chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are
                called
                biscuit. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the
                United
                Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squars or bars.</p>
